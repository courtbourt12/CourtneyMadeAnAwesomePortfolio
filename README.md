# Awesome Portfolio
---
## Description
My portfolio is going to teach me how to use more interactive Bootstrap content, SPA page design, and push myself to learn more in-depth programming concepts on my own. I want to make my portfolio fun, interactive, and colorful to reflect some of my personality within it. This portfolio will be media responsive so it is easily viewed on different screen sizes.
